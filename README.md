# 👋 Hey there! I'm Mathews

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! 🚀 

## 👀 What keeps me curious:
I'm deeply passionate about **GNU/Linux**, **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)**, and the endless possibilities technology brings to empower people and communities. 🐧💻 

## 🌱 Currently growing:
- Exploring advanced **Linux system administration** and **shell scripting**.
- Learning about **cloud-native technologies** like Kubernetes, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Diving into **TypeScript** and enhancing my **full-stack development** skills.

## 💞️ Let’s collaborate on:
- **Open-source contributions** that make a difference.
- Building cool **FOSS tools** for developers and enthusiasts.
- Anything related to **Linux**, **system design**, or **web technologies**.


## 😄 Pronouns:
He/Him

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I can talk about Linux distros all day—ask me about my favorite ones! Also, I firmly believe in "RTFM" *(Read The Fine Manual) with a smile. 😄📖
